# Word-Cloud

This repository was created as part of my university's **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course assignment. The goal of the project is to generate a **Word Cloud** visualization where my name, **RAKIBUL**, is prominently displayed at the center, surrounded by the names of 50 classmates from my section.

## Overview

The project utilizes Python programming and libraries to create a visually appealing word cloud. The emphasis of the project is on:

- Object-Oriented Design principles.
- Visual representation of data.
- Creating a Python script that processes textual data to generate a personalized word cloud.

## Features

- **Dynamic Input**: Generates a word cloud from a text file containing names.
- **Customization**: My name appears larger in the center of the cloud, with other names adjusted for size and positioning.
- **Simple Visualization**: Uses Python libraries to create an aesthetic output image.

## Files and Structure

- **`main.py`**: Contains the Python code for generating the word cloud.
- **`name.txt`**: A text file with 50 classmate names and my name.
- **`Rakibul.png`**: The output image of the word cloud generated by the script.
- **`Screenshot.png`**: A screenshot showcasing the word cloud result.
- **`Assignment.pdf`**: A PDF document explaining the project in detail.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `matplotlib`
- `wordcloud`
- `pillow`

To install these dependencies, use the command:

```bash
pip install matplotlib wordcloud pillow
```

## How to Run
